I have used Numpy and Matplot libraries.
I have created a function pdiff which approximates the partial differention wrt to a variable.
I have applied the method of Gradient Descent algorithm and demonstrated it using linear regression.
I have created a simple neural network which consists of one hidden layer. It consists of one input value and calculates one output value.
The model includes 2 weights and 2 biases which was tuned using 100 initial random values.
